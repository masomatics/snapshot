The data sets are presented by text files of space separated values (SSV) format. There are three types of data sets as below.

i) Data sets of experiments without the use of inhibitor. The file name indicates the condition of stimulation and measured molecules like: ssv_'GrowthFactor'_'molecule1'_'molecule2'.txt
In the text file, the order of columns is: 
1st column is the dose level of growth factor (see below).
2nd column is the time (min).
3rd column is the intensity of molecule1 (A.U.).
4th column is the intensity of molecule2 (A.U.).
(Each row is the measured each single cell.)
The data sets of i) were used for Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4D, E. 

ii) Data sets of experiments with the use of inhibitor. The file name indicates the condition of stimulation and inhibitor, and measured molecules like: ssv_'GrowthFactor'_'inhibitor'_'molecule1'_'molecule2'.txt
In the text file, the order of columns is: 
1st column is the dose level of growth factor (see below).
2nd column is the time (min).
3rd column is the intensity of molecule1 (A.U.).
4th column is the intensity of molecule2 (A.U.).
(Each row is the measured each single cell.)
The data sets of ii) were used for Fig.3 and Fig. 4D, E.

iii) Data set of Neurite length. The file name is "ssv_NGF_NeuriteLength.txt".
In the text file, the order of columns is:
1st column is the dose level of NGF (see below).
2nd column is the condition of inhibitor. 1:NGF(no use of inhibitor), 2:H89, 3:PD, 4:BIS, 5:NGF (duplicate)
3rd column is neurite length.
(Each row indicates each cell.)
The data set of iii) was used for Fig. 4F.

The dose level of growth factors is denoted by the number from 1 to 12. The number indicates the concentration of each growth factor as follows:
NGF: 0, 0.050, 0.087, 0.15, 0.26, 0.45, 0.78, 1.4, 2.4, 4.1, 7.0 ,12.2 ng/ml.
PACAP: 0, 0.050, 0.15, 0.46, 1.37, 4.1, 12.3, 37.0, 111, 333, 1000, 3000 nM. 
PMA: 0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0, 64.0, 128, 256, 512, 1024 ng/ml.
